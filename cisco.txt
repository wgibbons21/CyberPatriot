! Securing Cisco devices
!
! In Cisco IOS a line that begins with a "!" is a comment and not interpreted
! by the router/switch/firewall. Lines beginning with a "!" can be safely pasted into a router and
! will not be interpreted and will not be saved into configuration files
!
! This document contains common security configurations for Cisco devices. When
! an example is used with a particular interface e.g. "FastEthernet 0/0" ensure
! you modify it to match your desired interface
!
! Replace text within angle brackets <replace me> with your desired text. Make
! sure not to include the angle brackets when

! Enable encryption of passwords stored in the config file
service password-encryption

! Enforce minimum password length
security passwords min-length 10

! Enforce timeouts on access lines, require a local user account for login while
! not allowing shared line passwords
line vty 0 4
  no password
  login local
  exec-timeout 3 30
  transport input ssh  ! Will require ssh connections only (won't allow telnet)

line console 0
  no password
  login local
  exec-timeout 3 30

line aux 0
  no password
  login local
  exec-timeout 3 30

! Set a strong enable mode password - this is a type 8 password hash
enable algorithm-type sha256 secret <password>

! Create new users with a strong, type 8 password
username <username> algorithm-type sha256 secret <password>

! Set a login banner to warn unauthorized users of unauthorized use
banner login #

! To check login failures:
show login failures

! Configure SSH
hostname <hostname>
ip domain-name <domain.tld>
crypto key generate rsa general-keys modulus 1024
ip ssh version 2
ip ssh time-out 60
ip ssh authentication-retries 2

! Enable IOS resilience features
secure boot-image
secure boot-config

! Configure syslog
logging host <ip address of syslog server>
logging trap <level 0-7>
logging on

! Point router to NTP server for time
ntp server <ip address of NTP server>

! Generally good security practices
no cdp run
no lldp run
no ip directed-broadcast
no ip http server
no service password-recovery
no ip domain-lookup
no ip http secure-server
